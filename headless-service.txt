it is a special type of service that uses no clusterIP, instead provides direct access to pods. It is useful for staeful applications.

So to understand this, let's first understand how a normal service (non headless) works.

When service A needs to request service B, it first has the domain name for service B. So during DNS resolution, the domain name of
 service B gets resolved into a virtual IP (VIP) representing the cluserIP of service B. Then A requests to that VIP, which is then 
load balanced into a particular pod of service B through kube proxy. This is the flow when we don't care which pod receives the request.

Now, headless service enables us to communicate with a pod directly. How?

In this scenario, we set the cluserIP of service B to None. This tells kubernetes to not use kube proxy load balancing at all (by pass load balancing). 
So, during DNS resolution of domain name of service B, instead of getting a VIP of service B, we get the IP addresses of all the pods
associated with service B. Now, the client chooses which pod to communicate to. This enables statefulness since the client can keep
track of which pod it is communicating to.
